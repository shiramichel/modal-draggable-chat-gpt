## Introduction

This is a simple Python flask app with a modal chat window for the users to interact with GPT models within an empty web page. The goal of this project was to use GPT-4 available from Bing and gerenate a webpage with dragable modal chat window that would represent an interface for the user to interact with the OpenAI GPT model.

### Frontend

The frontend is written using Bootstrap as well as custom JavaScript to send user's query in the background and receive the response back from the OpenAI GPT model.

### Backend

The backend is written in Python flask with `/chat` and `/` routes to process user's queries.
